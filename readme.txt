Most likely PHP Curl is not installed or configured properly. Please request your server administrator to enable the PHP CURL extension (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php for details).

Alternatively, you can also manually include the script in the footer file ("wp-content/themes/default/footer.php" in your wordpress installation).
